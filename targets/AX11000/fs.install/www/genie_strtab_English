To access the router, you will type your router's WAN IP address into your browser's Address (in IE) or Location (in Netscape) field, followed by a colon (:) and the custom port number. For example, if your external address is 10.0.0.123 and you use port number 8080, enter in your browser:</p> <p><screen>http://10.0.0.123:8080</screen></p><hr><p name=access id=access></p><p><b>Allow Remote Access</b><p> For security, you should restrict access to as few external IP addresses as practical. <p><ul>Select <b>Only This Computer</b> to allow access by only one IP address.</ul><p><ul>Select <b>IP Address Range</b> to allow access from a range of IP addresses on the Internet.
